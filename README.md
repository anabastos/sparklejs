:sparkles: :star: Now your website can look like the past but on the future. :star: :sparkles:

**Sparkle.js** is a free, cute and 90s style library to make retro-looking websites on the world wide internet providing highly customizable geocities inspired effects and features like mouse sparkles :sparkles: and music :musical_note:.

We're inspired by the "anti-design brutalism" to make this lib and we think that the nostagia can have positive impact on the creativity and open a little bit the concept of what is good or bad design.

It's written Javascript using [Ramda.js](http://ramdajs.com/).
